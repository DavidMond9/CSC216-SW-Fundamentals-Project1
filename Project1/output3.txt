# Shopping Cart Simulation
* 1,Backlog,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Backlog] [Backlog] Express carts always choose the shortest line. If there are multiple shortest lines, an express cart chooses the one with the smallest index.

* 2,Owned,F,jep,sesmith5,false
- [Owned] [Backlog] Regular carts always choose the shortest line excluding the express register line (at index 0). If there are multiple shortest lines, a regular cart chooses one with the smallest index.
- [Owned] [Owned] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
