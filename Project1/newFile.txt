* 1,Backlog,Express Carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Backlog] Express carts always choose the shortest line. If there are multiple shortest lines, an express cart chooses the one with the smallest index.
* 2,Owned,Regular Carts,F,jep,sesmith5,false
- [Owned] Regular carts always choose the shortest line excluding the express register line (at index 0). If there are multiple shortest lines, a regular cart chooses one with the smallest index.
