# Shopping Cart Simulation
* 1,Backlog,Express Carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Backlog] klog] Express carts always choose the shortest line. If there are multiple shortest lines, an express cart chooses the one with the smallest index.
* 2,Owned,Regular Carts,F,jep,sesmith5,false
- [Owned] klog] Regular carts always choose the shortest line excluding the express register line (at index 0). If there are multiple shortest lines, a regular cart chooses one with the smallest index.
- [Owned] ed] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
* 3,Processing,Java Swing,KA,sesmith5,sesmith5,false
- [Processing] klog] Learn more about Swing to debug GUI.
- [Processing] ed] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.

* 5,Verifying,Calculating Wait Time,B,jdyoung2,sesmith5,false
- [Verifying] klog] Special carts are failing system tests associated with wait time.
- [Verifying] ed] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
- [Verifying] cessing] Replicated failure locally in unit test.
- [Verifying] ifying] Implementation complete. Requires peer inspection.
* 8,Done,Special Carts,F,jep,sesmith5,true
- [Done] klog] Special carts always choose the shortest special register line.
- [Done] ed] Adding to sesmith5 backlog.
- [Done] cessing] Created hierarchy to prepare for other cart types.
- [Done] ifying] Implementation complete. Requires peer inspection.
- [Done] e] No problems found during inspection.
* 10,Rejected,Flatbed carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Rejected] klog] Add flatbed carts to simulation.
- [Rejected] ed] Rejected. Flatbed carts won't fit through physical register stations.
# WolfScheduler
* 2,Rejected,Weekly Repeat,F,sesmith5,unowned,false
- [Rejected] klog] Events should have a weekly repeat of every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks.
- [Rejected] ed] Weekly repeat is unnecessary when creating ideal week.
* 5,Backlog,Add Event,F,sesmith5,unowned,false
- [Backlog] klog] Users can create events to identify places during their week where they have scheduled activities other than class.
* 6,Done,Add Course,F,sesmith5,jctetter,true
- [Done] klog] Users can add courses to their schedule.
- [Done] ed] Assigning to jctetter.
- [Done] cessing] Creating Course class.
- [Done] cessing] Adding error checking on course name.
- [Done] cessing] Adding tests for Course.
- [Done] ifying] Request peer review.
- [Done] e] Updates meet requirements and test pass.
