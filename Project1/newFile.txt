# Shopping Cart Simulation
* 1,Backlog,Express Carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Backlog] [Backlog] Express carts always choose the shortest line. If there are multiple shortest lines, an express cart chooses the one with the smallest index.
* 2,Owned,Regular Carts,F,jep,sesmith5,false
- [Owned] [Backlog] Regular carts always choose the shortest line excluding the express register line (at index 0). If there are multiple shortest lines, a regular cart chooses one with the smallest index.

- [Done] [Done] No problems found during inspection.
* 10,Rejected,Flatbed carts,F,jep,unowned,false
- [Rejected] [Backlog] Add flatbed carts to simulation.
